The work contributed to the MESH project (www.searchmesh.net) that received European Regional Development Funding through the INTERREG IIIb Community Initiative (www.nweurope.org). The aims of the survey were to acquire high resolution multibeam, sub-bottom profiler and seabed imagery data in the SW Approaches area, located approximately 320km southwest of Lands End.  The cruise not only mapped the variable morphology of the area, but also investigated the biological communities within the canyon system for the assessment of potential Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) under the EC Habitats and Birds Directive (Annex I) (Johnston et al. 2002).  The cruise also tested the application of the survey standards and protocols developed under the MESH project.

This aims to establish an appropriate programme of surveillance and monitoring for the Special Areas for Conservation (SAC) and to trial monitoring methodologies and protocols for the features of a site. The Loch Maddy project will assist in the development of best practise for future monitoring and reporting programmes for other marine SACs in the UK and Europe. The first phase (1998-9) concentrates on testing variability within methodologies and the determination of the minimum intensity of sampling necessary to provide adequate data for monitoring. The second phase (1999-2000) will concentrate on repeatability However, the major part of the 1998-9 study,  which concentrates on the use of acoustic ground discrimination systems (AGDS) for biotope mapping, will make use of previous mapping studies undertaken in 1996 and will provide valuable guidance for future studies on repeatability of mapping.

The Sound of Barrahas been selected as a possible Special Area of Conservation (pSAC) on the basis of the nationally important colony of common seals, Phoca vitulina, and also for the wide variety of habitats associated with shallow sandbanks which are slightly covered by seawater all the time. A number of the sandbank habitats are of considerable conservation value, most notably the extensive beds of the eelgrass Zostera marina and tide-swept maerl beds composed of the coralline red alga Phymatolithon calcareum. A comprehensive biotope mapping survey of the sublittoral habitats within the Sound was undertaken in August 2001, by a collaborative research group from the University of St Andrews, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh University and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).

Complaints from user groups of the loch range from causing scouring of the seabed, releasing locked-in contaminants (Eardley & Lankester, 2000) to salmon nets becoming inoperable and boat launching problems (Loch Ryan Advisory Management Forum, 1999).  Kirk McClure Morton, Belfast are currently involved in a project investigating the erosion and deposition of mobile sediments around Loch Ryan.  This has involved developing a hydrodynamic model of wave action on the loch, and how wave propagation differs between fast ferries and traditional shaped craft.  The effect of the wake from ferries on sediment transport is also being investigated.  This survey aimed to give a clearer understanding of the general distribution of different sediment types in Loch Ryan by using an Acoustic Ground Discrimination System, RoxAnn.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB000484""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Nature Conservation""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Research""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""AGDS""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Grabs""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificat","1989-01-01","2002-12-31","2006-04-30","Golding N., Alman S. & Service M.

"GB000945","","Sound of Harris - Biotopes","The Sound of Harris is a topographically complex marine area situated between North Uist and Harris in the Outer Hebrides. Very little is known of the marine biota of the area but it is likely to be largely unmodified by anthropogenic influences. An increased knowledge of the marine biotope distribution in the Sound of Harris is desirable in order to assess the potential impacts of any proposed future developments in the area. Specifically, proposals to build access causeways linking Hebridean Islands are increasingly under consideration. Such developments have the potential to radically modify environmental conditions in neighbouring marine habitats. This study utilised satellite imagery, underwater acoustic sensing techniques and biological ground surveys to develop a biotope distribution map of the area and relate this distribution to prevailing environmental conditions.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB000945""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Satellite imagery""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""AGDS""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Diver survey""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Grabs""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechniq","2005-08-09","2005-08-14","2007-06-30","Malthus, T.J., Harries, D.B., Karpouzli, E., Moore, C.G., Lyndon, A.R., Mair, J.M., Foster-Smith, B., Sotheran, I. and Foster-Smith, D.

The sandiest sediments were found in the sandwave field in the north of the northern survey area in depths of less than 90 m.  The transition to coarser sandy sediments with an increased percentage of shell debris, pebbles and gravel followed an abrupt transition away from the sandwave field and this was reflected in both the bathymetry and backscatter data.  The area of coarse sandy sediments covered the majority of the northern survey area at 90 m.  In deeper ground more stable mixed sediments became dominant.  Sparse patches of small boulders were found at several sites.  Using the broader JNCC interpreted definition of Annex 1 reefs (Johnston et al, 2002), it was apparent that areas within the SS.SMx.OMx/SS.SMx.CMx.FluHyd mapped area could be considered Annex 1 reef habitat.

This was done to establish a baseline biological data set that would facilitate the assessment of the condition of the reef habitats in the future and to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. The approach taken to achieve these objectives was to assess the extent and distribution of serpulid reefs from observations by diver along 110 transects around the loch. Detailed studies were also performed at four of the major serpulid reef sites in the loch. Here, distribution was examined with sidescan sonar, reef density by video and the community of organisms associated with the habitat by diver survey of the reefs themselves and of the surrounding sediment. The distribution and abundance of Modiolus was examined along seven relocatable transects and, at one of the major mussel beds, the size structure of the population and associated community surveyed.

As a result, the Southeast Strategic Regional Coastal Monitoring Programme has been able to upgrade their single-beam bathymetric surveys to achieve 100% seafloor coverage to IHO Order 1a standard through collaboration with the Maritime and Coastguard Agencys Civil Hydrography Programme. Although the main purpose is to survey the bathymetry of the seabed, the full coverage bathymetry combined with acoustic backscatter information collected during the swath bathymetry survey can be integrated with ground-truthing information to produce a series of detailed maps.","environment","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB001106""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Coastal monitoring""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Multibeam echosounder""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Diver survey""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Cores""}, {""Ori","2010-01-01","2010-12-31","2011-07-31","Kinnear, R.

The current study was initiated to investigate the extent of Annex I reef habitat at Haig Fras. Cefas and JNCC collected full-coverage multibeam bathymetric and backscatter data and associated ground-truthing data. This data has been analysed to update the extent of the Annex I reef and produce a broadscale habitat map. Seven biotopes were identified from drop camera transects with the predominant biotope characterised by Devonshire cup corals, sponges and crustose communities on wave-exposed circalittoral rock. The broadscale habitat map indicates the presence of four main biotopes; high energy circalittoral rock, moderate energy circalittoral rock, deep circalittoral coarse sediment and deep circalittoral sand.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB001115""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Multibeam echo sounder""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Drop camera""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""EUNIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, ","2011-01-20","2011-03-31","2012-03-01","Curtis, M., Diesing, M. and Stephens, D. 2012.

"GB001117","","Croker carbonate slabs, Mid-Irish Sea","In May 2008 (18-27 May), a survey commissioned by JNCC undertook seabed habitat investigations of two Areas of Search (AoS) for offshore SACs. The objectives of this survey, within the Submarine structures in the mid-Irish Sea AoS and the Solan Bank AoS, were to acquire high quality acoustic data capable of identifying and delineating habitats listed under Annex I of the 1992 EC Habitats Directive; primarily the Annex I habitat Submarine structures made by leaking gases in the former AoS and Annex I Reef habitat in the latter AoS. Surveys consisted of both broad-scale and fine-scale acoustic techniques, utilising sidescan sonar and multibeam swathe bathymetry, along with a variety of ground-truthing techniques including towed and drop down video/stills and Hamon grab sampling. A Rock dredge was also used at a few stations in order to gather samples of epibiota from hard substrata to assist with the taxonomic identification of the video and still images. The range of sampling techniques employed ensured that any Annex I habitats could be adequately described and  characterised. For both AoSs survey planning and interpretation of survey data utilised extensive pre-existing data sets.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB001117""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Multibeam echo sounder""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Side scan sonar""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Towed video""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Drop camera""}, ","2008-05-18","2008-05-27","2008-05-01","Whomersley, P., Wilson, C., Clements, A., Brown, C., Long, D., Leslie, A., Limpenny, D. 2010.

"GB100014","","Broadscale remote survey and mapping of sublittoral habitats and their associated biota in the Firth of Lorn: biotopes","Methodologies for broad scale mapping of sublittoral habitats and biota based on acoustic remote sensing was developed as the Broadscale Mapping Project (BMP), a three year project funded by a consortium consisting of the Crown Estate, the Countryside Council for Wales, English Nature, Scottish Natural Heritage and Newcastle University through the SeaMap Research Group. The project was also supported by the European Commissions Life programme. The Firth of Lorn study area was selected by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) because it encompassed a wide range of physical environmental conditions and had considerable existing conservation value. Part of the BMP study area was recently put forward as a possible Special Area of Conservation in recognition of the significant marine biological interest of both intertidal and subtidal rocky reefs. A nested survey strategy was developed for the Firth of Lorn which involved careful pre-planning and iterative field survey. By adopting this nested and iterative approach, the overall summary maps comprise a jigsaw of small maps where the underlying data vary in their level of detail. The main features and biota were mapped using  acoustic remote sensing techniques combined with biological sampling. Linking the biological data with the acoustic data was completed using classification techniques developed for processing satellite images.

This aims to establish an appropriate programme of surveillance and monitoring for the Special Areas for Conservation (SAC) and to trial monitoring methodologies and protocols for the features of a site. The Loch Maddy project will assist in the development of best practise for future monitoring and reporting programmes for other marine SACs in the UK and Europe. The first phase (1998-9) concentrates on testing variability within methodologies and the determination of the minimum intensity of sampling necessary to provide adequate data for monitoring. The second phase (1999-2000) will concentrate on repeatability However, the major part of the 1998-9 study, which concentrates on the use of acoustic ground discrimination systems (AGDS) for biotope mapping, will make use of previous mapping studies undertaken in 1996 and will provide valuable guidance for future studies on repeatability of mapping.

The BioMar team in Newcastle are evaluating methods to generate biotope distribution maps based on continuous data collected using acoustic methods. Point samples of detailed biotope data can be linked to the acoustic map. Acoustic data can validate the interpolation of biotope data and hence increase the degree of confidence attached to a biotope distribution map. These key physical factors can be relatively easily obtained using acoustic methods to give a much greater coverage than could be obtained by direct viewing of the biotopes. Thus biotope mapping is, in principle, a process of matching restricted information on biological components to more general coverage of key physical characteristics of the sea floor.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB100074""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Nature conservation""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""AGDS""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Towed video""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Grabs""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechniqu","1994-01-01","1994-12-31","1994-12-31","Davies, J., Foster-Smith, R.L. 1994.

"GB100075","","St Tudwal's Islands (Tremadoc Bay) lifeforms map","Mapping the distribution of benthic biotopes at Sarn Badrig and St. Tudwal's Island, Tremadoc Bay was undertaken as part of the BioMar Project, in collaboration with the Countryside Council for Wales. The BioMar team in Newcastle are evaluating methods to generate biotope distribution maps based on continuous data collected using acoustic methods. Point samples of detailed biotope data can be linked to the acoustic map. Acoustic data can validate the interpolation of biotope data and hence increase the degree of confidence attached to a biotope distribution map. These key physical factors can be relatively easily obtained using acoustic methods to give a much greater coverage than could be obtained by direct viewing of the biotopes. Thus biotope mapping is, in principle, a process of matching restricted information on biological components to more general coverage of key physical characteristics of the sea floor.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB100075""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Nature conservation""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""AGDS""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Towed video""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Grabs""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechniqu","1994-01-01","1994-12-31","1994-12-31","Davies, J., Foster-Smith, R.L. 1994.
